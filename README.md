# üèéÔ∏è AutoVault

Hey there! Welcome to AutoVault - our little corner of the blockchain where car enthusiasm meets digital collecting.

## What's this all about?

I've always been passionate about cars. From the first poster I hung on my wall (a Lamborghini Countach, if you're curious) to countless hours spent researching specs and histories. I wanted to create a space where fellow car lovers could collect and trade pieces of automotive history in digital form.

That's how AutoVault was born.

## What you'll find here

We've organized our collections into three main categories:

- **Classics** - Those timeless beauties that make you stop and stare. The curves of a '63 Corvette, the elegance of an E-Type Jag... you know the ones.
- **Supercars** - The speed demons. The bedroom poster legends. The ones that make you wonder if 700+ horsepower is really necessary (it absolutely is).
- **Concept Cars** - The dreamers. The "what ifs" of automotive design that push boundaries and imagine what could be.

## Getting started is simple

1. Connect your wallet (we use Keplr)
2. Browse around and find cars that speak to you
3. Place a bid or buy one outright
4. Show off your digital garage to friends!

## Under the hood

We built this on Andromeda Protocol because it makes the Web3 experience smooth, even if you're not a crypto expert. Our smart contracts are running on the Stargaze blockchain (Elgafar-1 testnet for now).

Each car NFT includes detailed specs, history, and high-quality imagery. We're working on adding engine sounds in the future too!

## For the technically curious

If you want to tinker with the code:

```bash
# Clone our repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/autovault.git

# Install what you need
cd autovault
npm install

# Fire it up locally
npm run dev
```

Check out the `config.ts` file if you want to see how the collections are set up.
